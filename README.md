javapns
=======

This is a test import of svn javapns repo from Google Code. Don't get too excited. I just wanted to
gauge the effort needed to migrate the project from Google Code to GitHub.

Javapns issue 132 is a request to move the project to GitHub. Many times these type of requests ("change this because
it's how I'd like it!") are kind of silly and a pain for the project maintainers. However, in this case, I think
a move to GitHub would benefit the project greatly.
